# United Airlines SpyHack 

United Airlines F&B Enhancement Initiative
Welcome to the United Airlines F&B Enhancement Initiative, a project born out of the United Airlines Hackathon.

# Problem Statement
Our mission is to elevate United Airlines' Food & Beverage (F&B) ratings and boost overall customer satisfaction. To achieve this, we aim to identify key pain points and address inventory challenges through data-driven recommendations.

# Approach:
Our journey began with two intensive days of meticulous data cleaning and analysis. The primary hurdle we encountered was the data distribution, which demanded innovative solutions. Additionally, integrating various data sources proved to be a complex task.

This hackathon not only propelled us towards our goal but also deepened our understanding of the company, fostering valuable insights for future improvements.
